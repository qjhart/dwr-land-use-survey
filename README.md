# California's DWR Land Use  Surveys as a consolidated map _dwr-land-use-survey_

California's DWR maintains a program to survey the State's
agricultural land <sup>[1]</sup>.  Over 70 different crop types have been included in
these surveys.  Ancillary information can also include irrigation
methods and sources of water, but this is not complete.

Non-agricultural land is surveyed to various levels of detail.

Field boundaries are deliniated usigin aerial photos, or more recently
digital imagery, and land classes are associated for each field.
DWR staff visually identify the land use on most, (over 95%) of
the developed land within each survey.

Since 1976, 88 seperate surveys have been performed.
